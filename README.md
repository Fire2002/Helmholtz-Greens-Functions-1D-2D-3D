Helmholtz-Greens-Functions-1D-2D-3D
Provided is a set of solutions to two problems from Griffiths' "Introduction to Elementary Particles" (http://nuclphys.sinp.msu.ru/books/b/Griffiths.pdf) relating to Green's functions.

Problem 1 is to find the plots of the Green's Functions for the Helmholtz equation in 1D, 2D, and 3D.

Problem 2 is to determine the Fourier transform of the Green's function to go from one state to another.
